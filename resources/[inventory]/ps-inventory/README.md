### Dependencies

- `oxmysql`
- `ox_lib`
- `qb-core`

### Installation

- Download the resource from the repo
- Drop the resource into your qb server resources
- Rename to `ps-inventory`
- Run `__install/database.sql` in your database
- Start resource in server.cfg after qb-core or esx core (If using targetting, make sure qb-target or ox_target is started before)
- Delete and remove `ps-inventory`
- Delete and remove `qb-shops`
- Delete and remove `qb-weapons`
- Replace all `exports['ps-inventory']` for `exports['ps-inventory']`
- Restart server

### Old QB Core Conversion:

- To use with old QB Core versions, please use the following variables in `config/config.lua`

```
-- Framework
Framework = "qb", -- "qb"

-- QB specific
OldCore = true, -- If you are using an older version of QB Core
ConvertInventories = true, -- Convert old QB core inventories
RemoveOldCoreInventories = false, -- Remove old core inventories during conversion
```

If `RemoveOldCoreInventories` is set to `true`, it is recommended to back up the following tables just in case you want to switch back:

```
stashitems
trunkitems
gloveboxitems
```

### Note:

- QB integration will attempt to stop `ps-inventory`, `qb-shop`, and `qb-weapons` as this inventory will replace those.

### Setup targetting

- In `server.cfg`, set `setr UseTarget true`
- In `ps-inventory` set `Config.Target` to either `qb` or `ox`

### Decay system

To activate the decay system:

For QBCore, add the following to an item in `qb-core/shared/items.lua`

```
item_name = { ..., decay = 5 } -- Decay is in minutes
```

### Adding Additional Items

- You can add additional items to your framework, or
- You can add them to the `config/items.config.lua`

Example:

```
id_card = {
    name = 'id_card',
    label = 'ID Card',
    weight = 0,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'id_card.png',
    unique = true,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = false,
    description = 'A card containing all your information to identify yourself',

    onUse = function (source, item)
        -- Do what you want here
    end
},

...
```
